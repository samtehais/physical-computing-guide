## LED

Light-emitting diode: a small, low-power light source used widely in electronics. Ideal as an introduction to physical computing on the Arduino.

## Physical computing

Computing that involves tangible things connected to a computer, beyond standard input and output devices like keyboards and monitors. Think buttons, lights, robots, alarms, sensors, home automation and so on. We love physical computing because as well as being lots of fun, it's such a powerful teaching and learning tool and encourages creativity, problem solving, and collaboration. Computing **beyond the screen** engages children of all ages, and you can make very cool stuff!
